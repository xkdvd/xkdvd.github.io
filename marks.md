Idaho Official Meetings at ISU - for people interested, meetings were being held at the Student Union Building at ISU and then moved to the college market - last I checked it's under new ownership. Clud was held in old town and seems to have moved to boise after that. 

BSU was holding meetings at the Student Union Building as well. 

ISLUG Idaho State Linux Users Group seems to have disbanded - we have local interest
